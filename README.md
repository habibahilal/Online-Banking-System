# Online-Banking-System

The overarching theme of this project is to create an online banking system. Online
banking systems are used on a daily basis by bank customers and have multiple modules
Personal Financial Management and Bill Payment and Donations, which allow clients to
carry out multiple functions without having to physically be at the bank. 
The repo holds documentations on the software engineering processes that takes place to 
achieve the final product, such as acquiring requirements, designing UML diagrams, and finally
implementing a UI. (Notice: there is no backend invovled in this project)
